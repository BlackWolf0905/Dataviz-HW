# Trigonometric Plot Visualization

This project demonstrates a simple visualization of trigonometric functions (`sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, and their product) using Python and Matplotlib.

## Description
The script generates a plot that includes:

1. **Three curves:**
   - `sin(x)` in blue (solid line)
   - `cos(x)` in red (dashed line)
   - `sin(x) * cos(x)` in green (dash-dotted line)
2. A shaded area between `sin(x)` and `cos(x)` to visualize the difference between these two functions, with a purple color and 20% opacity.

## Features
- Customizable line styles, colors, and widths for better visualization.
- A grid overlay for improved readability.
- Legends, labels, and a title for better understanding of the graph.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

## Usage
1. Save the script as `trig_plot.py`.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python trig_plot.py
   ```
3. A window displaying the plot will appear.

## Output
The plot includes:
- `sin(x)` curve in blue.
- `cos(x)` curve in red.
- `sin(x) * cos(x)` curve in green.
- A purple shaded area representing the space between the `sin(x)` and `cos(x)` curves.
